# stock_market_prediction_challenge
## Project Overview
In the financial market, the movement of stock prices are never entirely predictable. Having a reliable 
way to forecast stock prices is crucial for most trading strategies. Many techniques have been 
developed to make predictions, ranging from fundamental techniques that involve analysing 
company financial statements to technical analysis which utilises indicators derived from the prices. 
Different kind of market participants perform trades on the stock which causes the prices to vary 
intraday. These price movements form a non-stationary time series data. Although the series formed 
are often very noisy, one can extract signals from historical price trends in some occasions and 
forecast future prices.
